["introduction.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction 2.1 Why {backyard}? 2.2 When would you need {backyard}", " Chapter 2 Introduction 2.1 Why {backyard}? The main idea is that, with a {backyard} backend, users can focus on writing and don’t have to know anything about Markdown and/or about R &amp; {bookdown} to get involved in a bookdown project. This would facilitate collaboration between those who use R and those who don’t. Once deployed, a {backyard} backend is easy to access and use, and is suitable for tech/non-tech people. 2.2 When would you need {backyard} There are many situations where you might need {backyard}. Here are few ideas: You want your partner/parents/friends to proof-read your bookdown, but they don’t know anything about R and/or markdown. Let them re-read your content with a {backyard} backend. You are collaborating on a book with someone who is not an R aficionados. You’re a group of students doing group work at your university, and need a way to easily collaborate on the content. You’re more comfortable with using a visual backend. You want to provide a central server for writing books or manual in your company … "],

If you choose this option, the default Bookdown template is used pointing to an Index.Rmd of a bookdown already present on the machine You can pass to backyard::run_book() the location of the index.Rmd (then the app is launched for this bookdown), or the location of your home (for the folder selection invite, default is .). By default, the safe_mode parameter is set to TRUE. This mode creates, at launch time, a copy (in {path}/backyard_copy-{time}) of your current version of the bookdown folder. That way, if ever you do something wrong during your backyard session, you can still go back to the previous version. 3.2 About This first page gives you a quick overview of the book. 3.3 Chapters This tab has 2 other tabs: Chapter edit: edit a chapter in html with the WYSIWYG (What you see is what you get) editor. Don’t forget to save when you’re done. If you’re more comfortable with markdown, you can also use the “update as Markdown” interface of this window. Manage Chapter: Add, delete, rename, reorder chapters 3.3.1 About code blocks in interactive mode Code blocks are, on purpose, not editable in Interactive mode. You should switch to Markdown mode if you want to edit these elements. 3.4 Options The idea of this tab is that non-tech people don’t want to enter too many technical details, hence they have “textual” content to see. If you want to dig into the tech, two tabs can be used to do that. Global: edit some global options with a friendly UI Edit options manually: change the options of Index.Rmd, _output.yml and _bookdown.yml just as if you were in any editor Edit any file: open an editor for any file contained in same directory as the index.Rmd. ## Design Two things can be edited in this tab: CSS: edit, create and delete CSS files Highlight: change the book syntax highlighting "],

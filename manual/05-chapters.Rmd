## Chapter edit

### Interactive mode 

Edit a chapter in html with the WYSIWYG (What you see is what you get) editor. This interface gives you a series of buttons that can be used to edit your content. 

**Don’t forget to save when you’re done. **

If you’re more comfortable with markdown, you can also use the “update as Markdown” interface of this window.

#### About the code block in interactive mode

The code blocks are, by design, uneditable from the interactive mode. This design choice was made for several reasons: 

+ Prevent users from putting html tags inside the code block

+ If you're comfortable enough writing code, you should be good using the markdown interface :) The first purpose of the interactive mode is to be used by non-tech users.

## Manage Chapter

In this tab, you can:

+ Add, delete & rename chapters.  

+ Reorder the chapter with a drag'n'drop interface

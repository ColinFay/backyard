# Deploy

The best way to collaborate with this is to deploy this app on a server.

Here a minimalist Docker file that can launch a `{backyard}` backend:

```
FROM rocker/tidyverse

MAINTAINER Colin FAY "contact@colinfay.me"

RUN R -e "install.packages('remotes', repos = 'https://cran.rstudio.com/')"
RUN R -e "remotes::install_github('ColinFay/backyard')"

# Create a folder just for bookdowns
RUN mkdir /usr/home/bookdown

EXPOSE 2811

CMD R -e "backyard::run_book(host = '0.0.0.0', home = '/usr/home/bookdown')"

```

If you only wants to share one bookdown (assuming the boookdown is in the same dir as the Dockerfile):

```
FROM rocker/tidyverse

MAINTAINER Colin FAY "contact@colinfay.me"

RUN R -e "install.packages('remotes', repos = 'https://cran.rstudio.com/')"
RUN R -e "remotes::install_github('ColinFay/backyard')"

RUN mkdir /usr/local/bookdown

COPY bookdown /usr/bookdown/bookdown

EXPOSE 2811

CMD R -e "backyard:: run_book(indexrmd = '/usr/bookdown/bookdown/index/Rmd',host = '0.0.0.0')"

```

**Notes on Docker**Â 

+ By default, `{backyard}` is deployed on port 2811. It can be changed in `backyard::run_book`.

+ If you launch the app in a Docker container, be sure to use `host = '0.0.0.0'`

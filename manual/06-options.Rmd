# Options

The idea of this tab is that non-tech people don't want to enter too many technical details, hence they have “textual” content to see in the first tab. 

If you want to dig into the tech, two tabs can be used to do that. 

## Global

In this tab, you can edit some global options with a nice UI

## Edit options

Change the options of Index.Rmd, _output.yml and _bookdown.yml just as if you were in any editor

## Edit any file

Open an editor for any file contained in same directory as the index.Rmd.
